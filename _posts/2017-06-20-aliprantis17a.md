title: Differences of Opinion
abstract: This paper considers the resolution of ambiguity according to the scientific
  ideal of direct observation when there is a practical necessity for social learning.
  An agent faces ambiguity when she directly observes low-quality data yielding set-identified
  signals. I suppose the agent’s objective is to choose the single belief replicating
  what would occur with high-quality data yielding point-identified signals. I allow
  the agent to solve this missing data problem using signals observed through her
  network in combination with a model of social learning. In some cases the agent’s
  belief formation reduces to DeGroot updating and beliefs in a network reach a consensus.
  In other cases the agent’s updating can generate polarization and sustain clustered
  disagreement, even on a connected network where everyone observes the same data
  and processes that data with the same model.
