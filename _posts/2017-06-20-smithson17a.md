title: New Distributions for Modeling Subjective Lower and Upper Probabilities
abstract: This paper presents an investigation of approaches to modeling lower and
  upper subjective probabilities. A relatively unexplored approach is introduced,
  based on the fact that every cumulative distribution function (CDF) with support
  (0,1) has a “dual” CDF that obeys the conjugacy relation between coherent lower
  and upper probabilities. A new 2-parameter family of “CDF-Quantile” distributions
  with support (0,1) is extended via a third parameter for the purpose of modeling
  lower-upper probabilities. The extension exploits certain properties of the CDF-Quantile
  family, and the fact that continuous CDFs on (0,1) random variables form an algebraic
  group that is closed under composition. This extension also yields models for testing
  specific models of lower-upper probability assignments. Finally, the new models
  are applied to a real data-set, and compared with the alternative approaches for
  their relative advantages and drawbacks.
