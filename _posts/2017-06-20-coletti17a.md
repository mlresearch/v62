title: 'Bayesian Inference under Ambiguity: Conditional Prior Belief Functions'
abstract: 'Bayesian inference under imprecise prior information is studied: the starting
  point is a precise strategy $σ$ and a full B-conditional prior belief function $Bel_B$,
  conveying ambiguity in probabilistic prior information. In finite spaces, we give
  a closed form expression for the lower envelope $\underline{P}$ of the class of full
  conditional probabilities dominating $(Bel_B,σ)$ and, in particular, for the related
  “posterior probabilities”. The assessment $(Bel_B,σ)$ is a coherent lower conditional
  probability in the sense of Williams and the characterized lower envelope $\underline{P}$
  coincides with its natural extension.'
