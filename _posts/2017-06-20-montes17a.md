title: A Study of the Pari-Mutuel Model from the Point of View of Imprecise Probabilities
abstract: The Pari-Mutuel model is a distortion model that has its origin in horse
  racing. Since then, it has been applied in many different fields, such as finance
  or risk analysis. In this paper we investigate the properties of the Pari-Mutuel
  model within the framework of Imprecise Probabilities. Since a Pari-Mutuel model
  induces (2-monotone) coherent lower and upper probabilities, we investigate its
  connections with other relevant models within this theory, such as probability intervals
  and belief functions. We also determine the number of extreme points of the credal
  set induced by the Pari-Mutuel model and study how to combine the information given
  by multiple Pari-Mutuel models.
