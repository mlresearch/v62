title: Exchangeable Choice Functions
abstract: We investigate how to model exchangeability with choice functions. Exchangeability
  is a structural assessment on a sequence of uncertain variables. We show how such
  assessments constitute a special kind of indifference assessment, and how this idea
  leads to a counterpart of de Finetti’s Representation Theorem, both in a finite
  and a countable context.
