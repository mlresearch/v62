title: Modeling Markov Decision Processes with Imprecise Probabilities Using Probabilistic
  Logic Programming
abstract: We study languages that specify Markov Decision Processes with Imprecise
  Probabilities (\mboxMDPIPs) by mixing probabilities and logic programming. We propose
  a novel language that can capture \mboxMDPIPs and Markov Decision Processes with
  Set-valued Transitions (MDPSTs) we then obtain the complexity of one-step inference
  for the resulting MDPIPs and MDPSTs. We also present results of independent interest
  on the complexity of inference with probabilistic logic programs containing interval-valued
  probabilistic assessments. Finally, we also discuss policy generation techniques.
