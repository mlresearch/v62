title: 'The CWI World Cup Competition: Eliciting Sets of Acceptable Gambles'
abstract: 'We present an interface for eliciting sets of acceptable gambles on a three-outcome
  possibility space, discuss an experiment conducted for testing this interface, and
  present the results of this experiment. Sets of acceptable gambles form a representation
  for imprecise probabilities that is close to human behavior and eliciting them directly
  may improve the quality of the resulting uncertainty model. The experiment consisted
  of a betting competition for the 2014 FIFA World Cup: For each match bets were assigned
  based on the sets of acceptable gambles elicited from the participants. A new algorithm
  was designed for generating fair bets for assignment. Participant feedback indicated
  that improving the usability and transparency of the interface would ease the elicitation
  procedure. The experimentâ€™s results underlined that imprecision is an essential
  aspect of real-life uncertainty modeling.'
