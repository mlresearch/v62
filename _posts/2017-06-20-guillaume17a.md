title: Maximum Likelihood with Coarse Data based on Robust Optimisation
abstract: This paper deals with the problem of probability estimation in the context
  of coarse data. Probabilities are estimated using the maximum likelihood principle.
  Our approach presupposes that each imprecise observation underlies a precise one,
  and that the uncertainty that pervades its observation is epistemic, rather than
  representing noise. As a consequence, the likelihood function of the ill-observed
  sample is set-valued. In this paper, we apply a robust optimization method to find
  a safe plausible estimate of the probabilities of elementary events on finite state
  spaces. More precisely we use a maximin criterion on the imprecise likelihood function.
  We show that there is a close connection between the robust maximum likelihood strategy
  and the maximization of entropy among empirical distributions compatible with the
  incomplete data. A mathematical model in terms of maximal flow on graphs, based
  on duality theory, is proposed. It results in a linear objective function and convex
  constraints. This result is somewhat surprizing since maximum entropy problems are
  known to be complex due to the maximization of a concave function on a convex set.
