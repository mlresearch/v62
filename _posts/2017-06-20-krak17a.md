title: Efficient Computation of Updated Lower Expectations for Imprecise Continuous-Time
  Hidden Markov Chains
abstract: We consider the problem of performing inference with \emphimprecise continuous-time
  hidden Markov chains, that is, imprecise continuous-time Markov chains that
  are augmented with random \emphoutput variables whose distribution depends on the
  hidden state of the chain. The prefix ‘imprecise’ refers to the fact that we do
  not consider a classical continuous-time Markov chain, but replace it with a robust
  extension that allows us to represent various types of model uncertainty, using
  the theory of imprecise probabilities. The inference problem amounts to computing
  lower expectations of functions on the state-space of the chain, given observations
  of the output variables. We develop and investigate this problem with very few assumptions
  on the output variables in particular, they can be chosen to be either discrete
  or continuous random variables. Our main result is a polynomial runtime algorithm
  to compute the lower expectation of functions on the state-space at any given time-point,
  given a collection of observations of the output variables.
