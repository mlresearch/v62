title: 'Independent Natural Extension for Infinite Spaces: Williams-Coherence to the
  Rescue'
abstract: We define the independent natural extension of two local models for the
  general case of infinite spaces, using both sets of desirable gambles and conditional
  lower previsions. In contrast to Miranda and Zaffalon (2015), we adopt Williams-coherence
  instead of Walley-coherence. We show that our notion of independent natural extension
  always exists—whereas theirs does not—and that it satisfies various convenient properties,
  including factorisation and external additivity.
