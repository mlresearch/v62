title: Errors Bounds for Finite Approximations of Coherent Lower Previsions
abstract: Coherent lower previsions are general probabilistic models allowing incompletely
  specified probability distributions. However, for complete description of a coherent
  lower prevision – even on finite underlying sample spaces – an infinite number of
  assessments is needed in general. Therefore, they are often only described approximately
  by some less general models, such as coherent lower probabilities or in terms of
  some other finite set of constraints. The magnitude of error induced by the approximations
  has often been neglected in the literature, despite the fact that it can be significant
  with substantial impact on consequent decisions. An apparent reason is that no widely
  used general method for estimating the error seems to be available at the moment.
  The goal of this paper is to provide such a method. The proposed method allows calculating
  an upper bound for the error of a finite approximation of coherent lower prevision
  on a finite underlying sample space. An estimate of the maximal error is especially
  useful in the cases where calculating assessments is computationally demanding.
  Our method is based on convex analysis applied to credal sets, which in the case
  of finite sample spaces correspond to convex polyhedra.
