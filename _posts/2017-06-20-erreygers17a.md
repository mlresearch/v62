title: 'Imprecise Continuous-Time Markov Chains: Efficient Computational Methods with
  Guaranteed Error Bounds'
abstract: Imprecise continuous-time Markov chains are a robust type of continuous-time
  Markov chains that allow for partially specified time-dependent parameters. Computing
  inferences for them requires the solution of a non-linear differential equation.
  As there is no general analytical expression for this solution, efficient numerical
  approximation methods are essential to the applicability of this model. We here
  improve the uniform approximation method of Krak et al. (2016) in two ways and propose
  a novel and more efficient adaptive approximation method. For ergodic chains, we
  also provide a method that allows us to approximate stationary distributions up
  to any desired maximal error.
