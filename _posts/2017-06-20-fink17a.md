title: "(Generalized) Linear Regression on Microaggregated Data – From Nuisance Parameter
  Optimization to Partial Identification"
abstract: 'Protecting sensitive micro data prior to publishing or passing the data
  itself on is a crucial aspect: A trade-off between sufficient disclosure control
  and analyzability needs to be found. This paper presents a starting point to evaluate
  the effect of $k$-anonymity microaggregated data in (generalized) linear regression.
  Taking a rigorous imprecision perspective, microaggregated data are understood inducing
  a set $X$ of potentially true data. Based on this representation two conceptually
  different approaches deriving estimations from the \emphideal likelihood are discussed.
  The first one picks a single element of $\mathbbX$, for instance by naively treating
  the microaggregated data as true ones or by introducing a maximax approach taking
  the elements of $X$ as nuisance parameters to be optimized. The second one
  seeks, in the spirit of Partial Identification, the set of all maximum likelihood
  estimators compatible with the elements of $X$, thus creating cautious estimators.
  As the simulation study corroborates, the obtained sets of estimators of the latter
  approach are still precise enough to be practically relevant.'
