title: Computable Randomness is Inherently Imprecise
abstract: 'We use the martingale-theoretic approach of game-theoretic probability
  to incorporate imprecision into the study of randomness. In particular, we define
  a notion of computable randomness associated with interval, rather than precise,
  forecasting systems, and study its properties. The richer mathematical structure
  that thus arises lets us better understand and place existing results for the precise
  limit. When we focus on constant interval forecasts, we find that every infinite
  sequence of zeroes and ones has an associated filter of intervals with respect to
  which it is computably random. It may happen that none of these intervals is precise,
  which justifies the title of this paper. We illustrate this by showing that computable
  randomness associated with non-stationary precise forecasting systems can be captured
  by a stationary interval forecast, which must then be less precise: a gain in model
  simplicity is thus paid for by a loss in precision.'
