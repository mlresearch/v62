title: Agreeing to Disagree and Dilation
abstract: We consider Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis’s generalization of Aumman’s famous
  result on “agreeing to disagree", in the context of imprecise probability. The main
  purpose is to reveal a connection between the possibility of agreeing to disagree
  and the interesting and anomalous phenomenon known as dilation. We show that for
  two agents who share the same set of priors and update by conditioning on every
  prior, it is impossible to agree to disagree on the lower or upper probability of
  a hypothesis unless a certain dilation occurs. With some common topological assumptions,
  the result entails that it is impossible to agree not to have the same set of posterior
  probabilities unless dilation is present. This result may be used to generate sufficient
  conditions for guaranteed full agreement in the generalized Aumman-setting for some
  important models of imprecise priors, and we illustrate the potential with an agreement
  result involving the density ratio classes. We also provide a formulation of our
  results in terms of “dilation-averse” agents who ignore information about the value
  of a dilating partition but otherwise update by full Bayesian conditioning.
