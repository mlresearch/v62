title: Empirical Interpretation of Imprecise Probabilities
abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of a frequentist interpretation
  of imprecise probabilities, by generalizing the approach of Bernoulliâ€™s Ars
  Conjectandi. That is, by studying, in the case of games of chance, under which assumptions
  imprecise probabilities can be satisfactorily estimated from data. In fact, estimability
  on the basis of finite amounts of data is a necessary condition for imprecise probabilities
  in order to have a clear empirical meaning. Unfortunately, imprecise probabilities
  can be estimated arbitrarily well from data only in very limited settings.
