title: Concepts for Decision Making under Severe Uncertainty with Partial Ordinal
  and Partial Cardinal Preferences
abstract: We introduce three different approaches for decision making under uncertainty,
  if (I) there is only partial (both cardinal and ordinal) information on an agentâ€™s
  preferences and (II) the uncertainty about the states of nature is described by
  a credal set. Particularly, (I) is modeled by a pair of relations, one specifying
  the partial rank order of the alternatives and the other modeling partial information
  on the strength of preference. Our first approach relies on criteria that construct
  complete rankings of the acts based on generalized expectation intervals. Subsequently,
  we introduce different concepts of global admissibility that construct partial orders
  by comparing all acts simultaneously. Finally, we define criteria induced by suitable
  binary relations on the set of acts and, therefore, can be understood as concepts
  of local admissibility. Whenever suitable, we provide linear programming based algorithms
  for checking optimality/admissibility of acts.
