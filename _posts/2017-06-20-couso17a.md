title: 'Reconciling Bayesian and Frequentist Tests: the Imprecise Counterpart'
abstract: Imprecise Dirichlet Process-based tests (IDP-tests, for short) have been
  recently introduced in the literature. They overcome the problem of deciding how
  to select a single prior in Bayesian hypothesis testing, in the absence of prior
  information. They make use of a “near-ignorance” model, that behaves a priori as
  a vacuous model for some basic inferences, but it provides non-vacuous posterior
  inferences. We perform empirical studies regarding the behavior of IDP-tests for
  the particular case of Wilcoxon rank sum test. We show that the upper and lower
  posterior probabilities can be expressed as tail probabilities based on the value
  of the $U$ statistic. We construct an imprecise frequentist-based test that reproduces
  the same decision rule as the the IDP test. It considers a neighbourhood around
  the $U$-statistic value. If all the values in the neighbourhood belong to the rejection
  zone (resp. to the acceptance region), the null hypothesis is rejected (resp. accepted).
  Otherwise, the judgement is suspended.
