title: Computing Minimax Decisions with Incomplete Observations
abstract: Decision makers must often base their decisions on incomplete (coarse) data.
  Recent research has shown that in a wide variety of coarse data problems, minimax
  optimal strategies can be recognized using a simple probabilistic condition. This
  paper develops a computational method to find such strategies in special cases,
  and shows what difficulties may arise in more general cases.
