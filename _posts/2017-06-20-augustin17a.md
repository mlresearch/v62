title: Kurt Weichselberger’s Contribution to Imprecise Probabilities
abstract: Kurt Weichselberger, one of the influential senior members of the imprecise
  probability community, passed away on February 7, 2016. Almost throughout his entire
  academic life the major focus of his research interest has been on the foundations
  of probability and statistics. The present article is a first attempt to trace back
  chronologically the development of Weichselberger’s work on interval probability
  and his symmetric theory of logical probability based on it. We also try to work
  out the intellectual background of his different projects together with some close
  links between them.
