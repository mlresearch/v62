title: Linear Core-Based Criterion for Testing Extreme Exact Games
abstract: The notion of a (discrete) coherent lower probability corresponds to a game-theoretical
  concept of an exact (cooperative) game. The collection of (standardized) exact games
  forms a pointed polyhedral cone and the paper is devoted to the extreme rays of
  that cone, known as extreme exact games. A criterion is introduced for testing whether
  an exact game is extreme. The criterion leads to solving simple linear equation
  systems determined by (the vertices of) the core polytope (of the game), which concept
  corresponds to the notion of an induced credal set in the context of imprecise probabilities.
  The criterion extends and modifies a former necessary and sufficient condition for
  the extremity of a supermodular game, which concept corresponds to the notion of
  a 2-monotone lower probability. The linear condition we give in this paper is shown
  to be necessary for an exact game to be extreme. We also know that the condition
  is sufficient for the extremity of an exact game in an important special case. The
  criterion has been implemented on a computer and we have made a few observations
  on basis of our computational experiments.
