title: Credal Sum-Product Networks
abstract: Sum-product networks are a relatively new and increasingly popular class
  of (precise) probabilistic graphical models that allow for marginal inference with
  polynomial effort. As with other probabilistic models, sum-product networks are
  often learned from data and used to perform classification. Hence, their results
  are prone to be unreliable and overconfident. In this work, we develop credal sum-product
  networks, an imprecise extension of sum-product networks. We present algorithms
  and complexity results for common inference tasks. We apply our algorithms on realistic
  classification task using images of digits and show that credal sum-product networks
  obtained by a perturbation of the parameters of learned sum-product networks are
  able to distinguish between reliable and unreliable classifications with high accuracy.
