title: Imprecise Swing Weighting for Multi-Attribute Utility Elicitation Based on
  Partial Preferences
abstract: We describe a novel approach to multi-attribute utility elicitation which
  is both general enough to cover a wide range of problems, whilst at the same time
  simple enough to admit reasonably straightforward calculations. We allow both utilities
  and probabilities to be only partially specified, through bounding. We still assume
  marginal utilities to be precise. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions
  under which our elicitation procedure is consistent. As a special case, we obtain
  an imprecise generalization of the well known swing weighting method for eliciting
  multi-attribute utility functions. An example from ecological risk assessment demonstrates
  our method.
