title: Towards a Cautious Modelling of Missing Data in Small Area Estimation
abstract: In official statistics, the problem of sampling error is rushed to extremes
  when not only results on sub-population level are required, which is the focus of
  Small Area Estimation (SAE), but also missing data arise. When the nonresponse is
  wrongly assumed to occur at random, the situation becomes even more dramatic, since
  this potentially leads to a substantial bias. Even though there are some treatments
  jointly considering both problems, they are all reliant upon the guarantee of strong
  assumptions on the missingness. For that reason, we aim at developing cautious versions
  of well known estimators from SAE by exploiting the results from a recently suggested
  likelihood approach, capable of including tenable partial knowledge about the nonresponse
  behaviour in an adequate way. We generalize the synthetic estimator and propose
  a cautious version of the so-called LGREG-synthetic estimator in the context of
  design-based estimators. Then, we elaborate why the approach above does not directly
  extend to model-based estimators and proceed with some first studies investigating
  different missingness scenarios. All results are illustrated through the German
  General Social Survey 2014, also including area-specific auxiliary information from
  the German Federal Statistical Officeâ€™s data report.
