title: Efficient Computation of Belief Theoretic Conditionals
abstract: Dempster-Shafer (DS) belief theory is a powerful general framework for dealing
  with a wider variety of uncertainties in data. As in Bayesian probability theory,
  the conditional operation plays a critical role in DS theoretic strategies for evidence
  updating and fusion. A major limitation associated with the application of DS theoretic
  techniques for reasoning under uncertainty is the absence of a feasible computational
  framework to overcome the prohibitive computational burden this conditional operation
  entails. This paper addresses this critical challenge via a novel generalized conditional
  computational model — DS-Conditional-One — which allows the conditional to
  be computed in significantly less computational and space complexity. This computational
  model also provides valuable insight into the DS theoretic conditional itself and
  can be utilized as a tool for visualizing the conditional computation. We provide
  a thorough analysis and experimental validation of the utility, efficiency, and
  implementation of the proposed data structures and algorithms for carrying out both
  the Dempster’s conditional and Fagin-Halpern conditional, the two most
  widely utilized DS theoretic conditional strategies.
