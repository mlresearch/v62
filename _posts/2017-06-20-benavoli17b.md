title: A Polarity Theory for Sets of Desirable Gambles
abstract: Coherent sets of almost desirable gambles and credal sets are known to be
  equivalent models. That is, there exists a bijection between the two collections
  of sets preserving the usual operations, e.g. conditioning. Such a correspondence
  is based on the polarity theory for closed convex cones. Learning from this simple
  observation, in this paper we introduce a new (lexicographic) polarity theory for
  general convex cones and then we apply it in order to establish an analogous correspondence
  between coherent sets of desirable gambles and convex sets of lexicographic probabilities.
