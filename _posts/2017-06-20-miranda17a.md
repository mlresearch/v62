title: Game Solutions, Probability Transformations and the Core
abstract: 'We investigate the role of some game solutions, such the Shapley and the
  Banzhaf values, as probability transformations of lower probabilities. The first
  one coincides with the pignistic transformation proposed in the Transferable Belief
  Model the second one is not efficient in general, leading us to propose a normalized
  version. We consider a number of particular cases of lower probabilities: minitive
  measures, coherent lower probabilities, as well as the lower probabilities induced
  by comparative or distorsion models. For them, we provide some alternative expressions
  of the transformations and study when they belong to the core of the lower probability.'
