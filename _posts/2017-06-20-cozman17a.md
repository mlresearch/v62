title: Evenly Convex Credal Sets
abstract: An evenly convex credal set is a set of probability measures that is evenly
  convex that is, a set that is an intersection of open halfspaces. An evenly convex
  credal set can for instance encode preference judgments through strict and non-strict
  inequalities such as $\mathbbP\left(A\right) > 1/2$ and $\mathbbP\left(A\right)
  â‰¤2/3$. This paper presents an axiomatization of evenly convex sets from preferences,
  where we introduce a new (and very weak) Archimedean condition.
