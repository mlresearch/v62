title: SOS for Bounded Rationality
abstract: In the gambling foundation of probability theory, rationality requires that
  a subject should always (never) find desirable all nonnegative (negative) gambles,
  because no matter the result of the experiment the subject never (always) decreases
  her money. Evaluating the nonnegativity of a gamble in infinite spaces is a difficult
  task. In fact, even if we restrict the gambles to be polynomials in $R^n$,
  the problem of determining nonnegativity is NP-hard. The aim of this paper is to
  develop a computable theory of desirable gambles. Instead of requiring the
  subject to accept all nonnegative gambles, we only require her to accept gambles
  for which she can efficiently determine the nonnegativity (in particular SOS polynomials).
  We call this new criterion bounded rationality.
